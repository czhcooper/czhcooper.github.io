Hello, I'm Cooper—a versatile professional with a dual passion for biosciences and coding. I have experience as a bioinformatics engineer at a startup, where I managed website construction and maintenance, in addition to developing bio-software. I'm currently dedicated to becoming an independent developer who meets my own standards.

Besides that, I’m an avid cat lover, caring for two American Shorthairs—a golden shaded girl and a silver shaded munchkin. My goal is to adopt another golden shaded boy and a pair of Corgis.

I love wandering around and soaking up sights; my current stomping grounds are in Guangzhou. I dream of being a digital nomad, not confined to any specific spot.
