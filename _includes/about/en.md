Hi, I am *Cooper* (Zaohuang Chen), a Bioinformatics Engineer, and serve as the IT manager in my company. I enjoy being a 'slash' youth, having transitioned from a major in Civil Engineering to Biological research, and now working in the field of Bioinformatics. My wide range of interests includes Biology, Bioinformatics algorithms, programming, web development, and data visualization, among others. Furthermore, I took a two-year hiatus from my sophomore year in college to serve in the military.
