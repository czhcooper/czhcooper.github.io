Hey, I'm Cooper, a slashie with a knack for both biosciences and computing. I've worked as a bioinformatics engineer at a startup, handling website construction and maintenance as well as the development of bio-software. I am working hard to become an independent developer that satisfies my own standards.

Besides that, I'm an experienced cat owner, tending to two American Shorthair girlâ€”one golden shaded and one silver shaded munchkin. My goal is to adopt another golden shaded boy and a pair of Corgis.

I love wandering around and soaking up sights; my current stomping grounds are in Guangzhou. I dream of being a digital nomad, not confined to any specific spot.
