## Packages' installation in R

R packages are collections of functions and dataset developed by their authors.

**What are repositories?**

A repository is a plcae where packages are located so you can install them from it. Although you might have a local repository, typically R packages are located at remote servers and you can install them online. There are three most popular repositories for R as following:

- [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/): the official repository, it is a network of ftp and web servers maintained by the R community around the world. The R foundation coordinates it, and for a package to be published here, it needs to pass several tests that ensure the package is following CRAN policies. You can find more details [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html).
- [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/): this is a topic specific repository, intended for open source software for bioinformatics. As CRAN, it has its own [submission and review processes](https://www.bioconductor.org/developers/package-submission/), and its community is very active having several conferences and meetings per year.
- [Github](https://github.com/) : although this is not R specific, Github is probably the most popular repository for open source projects. Its popularity comes from the unlimited space for open source, the integration with git, a version control software, and its ease to share and collaborate with others. But be aware that there is no review process associated with it.

**How to install An R Package**

Install an R package from CRAN

```
install.packages("vioplot")
```

Install it from a specific repository (CRAN mirrors). You can select your micro by using `chooseCRANmirror()`or just adding "repo"parameter after `install.package`

```
install.packages("vioplot", repo = "https://lib.ugent.be/CRAN/")

```

or change "repo" to Tsinghua's mirror

```
install.packages("vioplot", repo = "https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/CRAN/")
```



**Install R package from  Bioconductor**

```
BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
```







The first thing to do is checking what kind of proxy you're using. I'm using V2ray now, so check it's configure:

Open Terminal and code the following:



```
vim ~/.Renviron
```

Save it . Done!

If the above resolution doesn't work, try this at **Rstudio**: using http proxy

```
Sys.setenv(all_proxy="http://127.0.0.1:8001")
```

If you want to remove this variable:

```
Sys.unsetenv("all_proxy")
```



Can not install packages from GitHub using `devtools::install_github()`? Try the following codes:

```
options(download.file.method = "libcurl") # or you can change the "libcurl" to "wget", which just works for me

options(download.file.method = "wget")
```



### Damn it

It's often occurred that you can not install any packages using `BiocManager:install` when you're setting proxy in R. What the hell it is going on here?

```
Sys.setenv(all_proxy="http://127.0.0.1:8001")
```

However, if you remove this setting, it will work normally!

```
Sys.unsetenv("all_proxy")
```

I may need to figure it out how proxy in R work.

### Download a file from Internet

`wget` vs `curl`

`curl` is a command line tool and a library which can be used to receive and send data between a client and a server over the internet.  `curl` supports a wide range of protocols such as HTTP/HTPPS, FTP, IMAP, LDAP, POP3, etc. Owing to its versatile traits, `curl` has been used in many applications and for many use cases. For examples, it can be used to download files, testing APIs and checking network problems. 

Install `curl` in macOS:

```
brew install curl
```

For instance, the following command will receive the HTML page from ==baidu.com==

```
curl http://baidu.com > test.html
```

If without `>test.html`,  `curl` receive the HTML page and directly print it to the screen of terminal. Alternatively, you can use the `-0` option, like

```
curl -o test.html http://baidu.com 
```
